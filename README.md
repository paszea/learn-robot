I know coding. But robots are always a mystery to me until early April 2025, two weeks after I learned about [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) open source project, I built a so100 arm. In the two and half months that followed, I felt like a child in a candy shop. I tinkered and experimented. I learned robotics and built demos and projects that I could only dreamed of at the start of April 2025. Below is a brief account of this journey.

I trained my first VLA model, ACT, soon after the arm was built. What a magic moment is it to watch a lifeless arm sprang into life seeking and grasping!
